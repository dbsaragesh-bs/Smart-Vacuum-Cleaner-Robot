# Smart Vacuum Cleaner Robot

## Overview

The Smart Vacuum Cleaner Robot is an floor-cleaning robot designed and built as part of the course *Computational Physics* at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. It is capable of navigating environments, avoiding obstacles, and cleaning surfaces using a motor-driven vacuum mechanism.

This project combines embedded systems, sensor integration, and basic robotics to provide a cost-efficient and functional home cleaning assistant. The robot uses ultrasonic sensing for obstacle avoidance, motor drivers for motion control, and Arduino Uno as the central controller.

## Working Principle

1. **Initialization**: Robot checks for obstacles ahead using an ultrasonic sensor.
2. **Movement**: If no obstacle is detected within the stop distance, it moves forward.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: On detection, the robot decelerates, analyzes surroundings using a servo-mounted sensor, and turns in the direction with more free space.
4. **Vacuuming**: A separate vacuum fan continuously collects dust from the floor during motion.
5. **Loop**: The process repeats, making it an efficient cleaning cycle.
